If I hadn't changed my mind that night I would never have found out the truth.
I couldn't believe that Carla had slept with another man, that she had lied about her love for me - and
that I might be second or even third in her affections.
Carla had phoned me at the office during the day, something I had told her not to do, but since I also
warned her never to call me at home she hadn't been left with a lot of choice. As it turned out; all she had
wanted to let me know was that she wouldn't be able to make it for what the French so decorously call a
"cinq ï¿½ sept." She had to visit her sister in Fulham who had been taken ill, she explained.
I was disappointed. It had been another depressing day, and now I was being asked to forgo the one
thing that would have made it bearable.
"I thought you didn't get on well with your sister," I said tartly.
There was no immediate reply from the other end. Eventually Carla asked, "Shall we make it next
Tuesday, the usual time?"
"I don't know if that's convenient," I said. "I'll call you on Monday when I know what my plans are." I
put down the receiver.
Wearily, I phoned my wife to let her know I was on the way home - something I usually did from the
phone box outside Carla's flat. It was a trick I often used to makeElizabethfeel she knew where I was
every moment of the day.
Most of the office staff had already left for the night so I gathered together some papers I could work
on at home. Since the new company had taken us over six months ago, the management had not only
sacked my Number Two in the accounts department but expected me to cover his work as well as my
own. I was hardly in a position to complain, since my new boss made it abundantly dear that if I didn't
like the arrangement I should feel free to seek employment elsewhere. I might have, too, but I couldn't
think of many firms that would readily take on a man who had reached that magic age somewhere
between the sought-after and the available.
As I drove out of the office car park and joined the evening rush hour I began to regret having been so
sharp with Carla. After all, the role of the other woman was hardly one she delighted in. The feeling of
guilt persisted, so that when I reached the corner ofSloane Square, I jumped out of my car and ran
across the road.
"A dozen roses," I said, fumbling with my wallet.
A man who must have made his profit from lovers selected twelve unopened buds without comment.
My choice didn't show a great dealof imagination but at least Carla would know I'd tried.
I drove on towards her flat, hoping she had not yet left for her sister's, that perhaps we might even find
time for a quick drink. Then I remembered that I had already told my wife I was on the way home. A
few minutes' delay could be explained by my staying on for a drink.
When I arrived at Carla's home I had the usual trouble finding a parking space, until I spotted a gap that
would just take a Rover opposite the paper shop. I stopped and would have backed into the space had I
not noticed a man coming out of the entrance to her block of flats. I wouldn't have given it a second
thought if Carla hadn't followed him a moment later. She stood there in the doorway, wearing a loose
blue housecoat. She leaned forward to give her departing visitor a kiss that could hardly have been
described as sisterly. As she closed the door I drove my car round the corner and double-parked.
I watched the man in my rear-view mirror as he crossed the road, went into the newsagent and a few
moments later reappeared with an evening paper and what looked like a packet of cigarettes. He walked
to his car, a blue BMW, stopped to remove a parking ticket from his windscreen and appeared to curse.
How long had the BMW been there? I even began to wonder if he had been with Carla when she
phoned to tell me not to come round.
The man climbed into the BMW, fastened his seat belt and lit a cigarette before driving off. Itook his
parking meter space in part-payment for my woman. I didn't consider it a fair exchange. I checked up
and down the street, as I always did, before getting out and walking over to the block of flats. It was
already dark and no one gave me a second glance. I pressed the bell marked 'Moorland'.
When Carla opened the front door I was greeted with a huge smile which quickly turned into a frown,
then just as quickly back to a smile. The first smile must have been meant for the BMW man. I often
wondered why she wouldn't give me a front door key. I stared into those blue eyes that had first
captivated me so many months ago. Despite her smile, those eyes now revealed a coldness I had never
seen before.
She turned to re-open the door and let me into her ground-floor flat. I noticed that under her housecoat
she was wearing the wine-red negligee I had given her for Christmas. Once inside the flat I found myself
checking round the room I knew so well. On the glass table in the centre of the room stood the 'Snoopy'
coffee mug I usually drank from, empty. By its side was Carla's mug, also empty, and a dozen roses
arranged in a vase. The buds were just beginning to open.
I have always been quick to chide and the sight of the flowers made it impossible for me to hide my
anger.
"And who was the man who just left?" I asked.
"An insurance broker," she replied, removing the mugs from the table.
"And what was he insuring?" I asked."Your love-life?"
"Why do you automatically assume he's my lover?" Her voice had begun to rise.
"Do you usually have coffee with an insurance broker in your negligee? Come to think of it, my
negligee."
"I'll have coffee withwhom I damn well please," she said, "and wearing what I damn well please,
especially when you are on your way home to your wife."
"But I had wanted to come to you -"
"And then return to your wife. In any case, you're always telling me I should lead my own life and not
rely on you," she added, an argument Carla often fell back on when she had something to hide.
"You know it's not that easy."
"I know it's easy enough for you to jump into bed with me whenever it suits you. That's all I'm good for,
isn't it?"
"That's not fair."
"Not fair? Weren't you hoping for your usual at six so you could still be home at seven in time for
supper withElizabeth?"
"I haven't made love to my wife in years!" I shouted.
"We only have your word for that," she spat out with scorn.
"I have been utterly faithful to you."
"Which means I always have to be to you, I suppose?"
"Stop behaving like a whore."
Carla's eyes flashed as she leaped forward and slapped me across the face with all the strength she
could muster.
I was still slightly off-balance when she raised her arm a second time, but as her hand came swinging
towards me I blocked it and was even able to push her back against the mantelpiece. She recovered
quickly and came flying at me again.
In a moment of uncontrolled fury, just as she was about to launch herself on me, I clenched my fist and
took a swing at her. I caught her on the side of the chin, and she wheeled back from the impact. I
watched her put an arm out to break her fall. But before she had the chance to leap back up and
retaliate, I turned and strode out, slamming the flat door behind me.
I ran down the hall, out on to the street, jumped into my car and drove off quickly. I couldn't have been
with her for more than ten minutes. Although I felt like murdering her at the time I regretted having hit her
long before I reached home. Twice I nearly turned back. Everything she had complained about was fair
and I wondered if I dared phone her from home. Although Carla and I had only been lovers for a few
months, she must have known how much I cared.
IfElizabethhad intended to comment on my being late, she changed her mind the moment I handed her
the roses. She began to arrange them in a vase while I poured myself a large whisky. I waited for her to
say something as I rarely drank before dinner but she seemed preoccupied with the flowers. Although I
had already made up my mind to phone Carla and try to make amends, I decided I couldn't do it from
home. In any case, if I waited until the morning when I was back inthe of lice, she might by then have
calmed down a little.
I woke early the next day and lay in bed, considering what form my apology should take. I decided to
invite her to lunch at the little French bistro she liked so much, half way between my office hers. Carla
always appreciated seeing me in the middle of the day, when she knew it couldn't be for sex. After I had
shaved and dressed I joinedElizabethfor breakfast, and seeing there was nothing interesting on the front
page, I turned to the financial section. The company's shares had fallen again, following City forecasts of
poor interim profits. Millions would undoubtedly be wipedoffour share value following such a bad piece
of publicity. I already knew that when it came to publishing the annual accounts it would be a miracle if
the company didn't declare a loss.
After gulping down a second cup of coffee I kissed my wife on the cheek and made for the car. It was
then that I decided to drop a note through Carla's letterbox rather than cope with the embarrassment of a
phone call.
"Forgive me," I wrote."Marcel's,one o'clock.Sole Veroniqueon a Friday.Love, Casaneva." I rarely
wrote to Carla, and when I did I only ever signed it with her chosen nickname.
I took a short detour so that I could pass her home but was held up by a traffic jam. As I approached
the flat I could see that the hold-up was being caused by some sort of accident. It had to be quite a
serious one because there was an ambulance blocking the other side of the road and delaying the flow of
oncoming vehicles. A traffic warden was trying to help but she was only slowing things down even more.
It was obvious that it was going tobe impossible to park anywhere near Carla's flat, so I resigned myself
to phoning her from the office. I did not relish the prospect.
I felta sinking feeling moments later when I saw that the ambulance was parked only a few yards from
the front door to her block of flats. I knew I was being irrational but I began to fear the worst. I tried to
convince myself it was probably a road accident and had nothing to do with Carla.
It was then that I spotted the police car tucked in behind the ambulance.
As I drew level with the two vehicles I saw that Carla's front door was wide open. A man in a long
white coat came scurrying out and opened the backofthe ambulance. I stopped my car to observe more
carefully what was goingon, hoping the man behind me would not become impatient. Drivers coming
from the other direction raised a hand to thank me for allowing them to pass. I thought I could let a dozen
or so through before anyone would start to complain. The traffic warden helped by urging them on.
Then a stretcher appeared at the end of the hall. Two uniformed orderlies carried a shrouded body out
on to the road and placed-it in the back of the ambulance. I was unable to see the face because it was
covered by the sheet, but a third man, who could only have been a detective, walked immediately behind
the stretcher. He was carrying a plastic bag, inside which I could make out a red garment that I feared
was the negligee I had given Carla.
I vomited my breakfast all over the passenger seat, my head finally resting on the steering wheel.
A moment later they closed the ambulance door, a siren started up and the traffic warden began waving
me on. The ambulance moved quickly off and the man behind me started to press his horn. He was, after
all, only an innocent bystander. I lurched forward and later couldn't recall any part of my journey to the
office..
Once I had reached the office car park I cleared up the mess on the passenger seat as best I could and
left a window open before taking a lift to the washroom on the seventh floor. I tore my lunch invitation to
Carla into little pieces and flushed them down the lavatory. I walked into my room on the twelfth floor a
little aftereight thirty, to find the managing director pacing up and down in front of my desk, obviously
waiting for me. I had quite forgotten that it was Friday and he always expected the latest completed
figures to be ready for his consideration.
This Friday it turned out he also wanted the projected accounts for the months of May, June and July. I
promised they would be on his desk bymidday. The one thing I needed was a clear morning and I was
not going to be allowed it.
Every time the phone rang, the door opened or anyone even spoke to me, my heart missed abeatI
assumed it could only be the police. BymiddayI had finished some sort of report for the managing
director, but I knew he would find it neither adequate nor accurate. As soon as I had deposited the
papers with his secretary, I left for an early lunch. I realised I wouldn't be able to eat anything, but at least
I could get hold of the first edition of the Standard and search for any news they might have picked up
about Carla's death.
I sat in the corner of my local pub where I knew I couldn't be seen from behind the bar. A tomato juice
by my side, I began slowly to turn the pages of the paper.
She hadn't made page one. She hadn't made the second, third or fourth page. And on page five she
rated only a tiny paragraph. "Miss Carla Moorland, aged 31, was found dead at her home in Pimlico
earlier this morning." I remember thinking at the time they hadn't even got her age right. "Detective
Inspector Simmons, who has been put in charge of the case, said that an investigation was being carried
out and they were awaiting the pathologist's report but to date they had no reason to suspect foul play."
After that piece of news I even managed a little soup and a roll. Once I had read the report a second
time I made my way back tothe of lice car park and sat in my car. I wound down the other front window
to allow more fresh air in before turning on the WorldAt One on the radio. Carla didn't even get a
mention. In the age of pump shotguns, drugs, Aids and gold bullion robberies the death of a thirty
two-year-old industrial personal assistant had passed unnoticed by the BBC.
I returned to my of lice to find on my desk a memo containing a series of questions that had been fired
back from the managing director, leaving me in no doubt as to how he felt about my report. I was able to
deal with nearly all his queries and return the answers to his secretary before I left the office that night,
despite spending most of the afternoon trying
toconvince myself that whatever had caused Carla's death must have happened after I left and could not
possibly have been connected with my hitting her. But that red negligee kept returning to my thoughts.
Was there any way they could trace it back to me? I had bought it at Harrods - an extravagance, but I
felt certain it couldn't be unique and it was still the only serious present I'd ever given her. But the note
that was attached - had Carla destroyed it? Would they discover who Casaneva was?
I drove directly home that evening, aware that I would never again be able to travel down the road
Carla had lived in. I listened to the end of the PM programme on my car radio and as soon as I reached
home switched on thesix o'clocknews. I turned to Channel Four at seven and back to the BBC at nine. I
returned to ITV at ten and even ended up watchingNewsnight .
Carla's death, in their combined editorial opinion, must have been less important than a Third-Division
football result betweenReadingandWalsall.Elizabethcontinued reading her latest library book, oblivious to
my possible peril.
I slept fitfully that night, and as soon as I heard the papers pushed through the letterbox the next morning
I ran downstairs to check the headlines.
"DUKAKIS NOMINATED AS CANDIDATE" stared up at me from the front page of The Times.
I found myself wondering, irrelevantly, if he would ever be President. "President Dukakis" didn't sound
quite right to me.
I picked up my wife's Daily Express andthe three -word headline filled the top of the page: "LOVERS'
TIFF MURDER".
My legs gave way and I fell to my knees. I must have made a strange sight, crumpled up on the floor
trying to read that opening paragraph. I couldn't make out the words of the second paragraph with- out
my spectacles. I stumbled back upstairs with the papers and grabbed the glasses from the table on my
side of the bed.Elizabethwas still sleeping soundly. Even so, I locked myself in the bathroom where I
could read the story slowly and without fear of interruption.
Police are now treating as murder the death of a beautiful Pimlico secretary, Carla Moorland, 32, who
was found dead in her flat early yesterday morning. Detective Inspector Simmons of Scotland Yard, who
is in charge of the case, initially considered Carla Moorland's death to be due to natural causes, but an
X-ray has revealed a broken jaw which could have been caused in a fight.
An inquest will be held on April 19th.
Miss Moorland's daily, Maria Lucia (4 8), said - exclusively to the Express- that her employer had been
with a man friend when she had left the flat atfive o'clockon the night in question. Another witness, Mrs
Rita Johnson, who lives in - the adjoining block of flats, stated she had seen a man leaving Miss
Moorland's flat at around six, before entering the newsagents opposite and later driving away. Mrs
Johnson added that she couldn't be sure of the make of the car but it might have been a Rover . . .
"Oh, my God," I exclaimed in such a loud voice that I was afraid it might have wokenElizabeth. I
shaved and showered quickly, trying to think as I went along. I was dressed and ready to leave for work
even before my wife had woken. 1 kissed her on the cheek but she only turned over, so I scribbled a
note and left it on her side of the bed, explaining that I had to spend the morning in the office as I had an
important report to complete.
On my journey to work I rehearsed exactly what I was going to say. I went over it again and again. I
arrived on the twelfth floor a little before eight and left my door wide open so I would be aware of the
slightest intrusion. I felt confident that I had a clear fifteen, even twenty minutes before anyone else could
be expected to arrive.
Once again I went over exactly what I needed to say. I found the number in the L-R directory and
scribbled it down on a pad in front of me before writing five headings in block capitals, something I
always did before a board meeting.
BUS STOP
COAT
NO. 19
BMW
TICKET
Then I dialled the number.
I took off my watch and placed it in front of me. I had read somewhere that the location of a telephone
call can be traced in about three minutes.
A woman's voice said, "Scotland Yard."
"Inspector Simmons, please," was all I volunteered.
"Can I tell himwho's calling?"
"No, I would prefer not to give my name."
"Yes, of course, sir," she said, evidently used to such callers.
Another ringing tone.My mouth went dry as a man's voice announced "Simmons" and- I heard the
detective speak for the first time. I was taken aback to find that a man with so English a name could have
such a strong Glaswegian accent.
"Can I help you?" he asked.
"No, but I think I can help you," I said in a quiet tone which I pitched considerably lower than my
natural speaking voice.
"How can you help me, sir?"
"Are you the officer in charge of the Carla whatever-her-name-is case?"
"Yes, I am. But how can you help?" he repeated.
The second hand showed one minute had already passed.
"I saw a man leaving her flat that night."
"Where were you at the time?"
"At the bus stop on the same side of the road."
"Can you give me a description of the man?" Simmons's tone was every bit as casual as my own.
"Tall. I'd sayfive eleven, six foot. Well built. Wore one of those posh City coats - you know, the black
ones with a velvet collar."
"How can you be so sure about the coat?" the detective asked.
"It was so cold standing out there waiting for the No. 19 that I wished it had been me who was wearing
it."
"Do you remember anything in particular that happened after he left the flat?"
"Only that he went into the paper shop opposite before getting into his car and driving away."
"Yes, we know that much," said the Detective Inspector. "I don't suppose you recall what make of car
it was?"
Two minutes had now passed and I began to watch the second hand more closely.
"I think it was a BMW," I said.
"Do you remember the colour by any chance?"
"No, it was too dark for that." I paused. "But I saw him tear a parking ticketoffthe windscreen, so it
shouldn't be too hard for you to trace him."
"And at what time did all this take place?"
"Aroundsix fifteen to six thirty, Inspector," I said.
"And can you tell me . . . ?"
Two minutes fifty-eight seconds. I put the phone back on the hook. My whole body broke out in a
sweat.
"Good to see you in the office on a Saturday morning," said the managing director grimly as he passed
my door. "Soon as you're finished whatever you're doing I'd like a word with you."
I left my desk and followed him along the corridor into his office. For the next hour he went over my
projected figures, but however hard I tried I couldn't concentrate. It wasn't long before he stopped trying
to disguise his impatience.
"Have you got something else on your mind?" he asked as he closed his file. "You seem preoccupied."
"No," I insisted, "just been doing a lot of overtime lately," and stood up to leave.
Once I had returned to my office, I burnt the piece of paper with the five headings and left to go home.
In the first edition of the afternoon paper, the "Lovers' Tilts' story had been moved back to page seven.
They had nothing new to report.
The rest of Saturday seemed interminable but my wife's Sunday Express finally brought me some relief.
"Following up information received in the Carla Moorland 'Lovers' Tills murder, a man is helping the
police with their inquiries." The commonplace expressions I had read so often in the past suddenly took
on a real meaning.
I scoured the other Sunday papers, listened to every news bulletin and watched each news item on
television. When my wife became curious I explained that there was a rumour in the office that the
company might be taken over again, which meant I could lose my job.
By Monday morning the Daily Express had named the man in "The Lovers' Tiff murder" as Paul
Menzies (51), an insurance broker from Sutton. His wife was at a hospital in Epsom under sedation while
he was being held in the cells of Brixton Prison under arrest. I began to wonder if Mr Menzies had told
Carla the truth about his wife and what his nickname might be. I poured myself a strong black coffee and
left for the office.
Later that morning, Menzies appeared before the magistrates at theHorseferry Roadcourt, charged with
the murder of Carla Moorland. The police had been successful in opposing bail, the Standard reassured
me.
* * *
It takes six months, I was to discover, for a case of this gravity to reach the Old Bailey. Paul Menzies
passed those months on remand in Brixton Prison. 1 spent the same period fearful of every telephone
call, every knock on the door, every unexpected visitor. Each one created its own nightmare. Innocent
people have no idea how many such incidents occur every day. I went about my job as best I could,
often wondering if Menzies knew of my relationship with Carla, if he knew my name or if he even knew
of my existence.
It must have been a couple of months before the trial was due to begin that the company held its annual
general meeting. It had taken some considerable creative accountancy on my part to produce a set of
figures that showed us managing any profit at all. We certainly didn't pay our share- holders a dividend
that year.
I came away from the meeting relieved, almost elated. Six months had passed since Carla's death and
not one incident had occurred during that period to suggest that anyone suspected I had even known her,
let alone been the cause of her death. I still felt guilty about Carla, even missed her, but after six months I
was now able to go for a whole day without fear entering my mind. Strangely, I felt no guilt about
Menzies's plight. After all, it was he who had become the instrument that was going to keep me from a
lifetime spent in prison. So when the blow came it had double the impact.
It was on August 26th - I shall never forget it - that I received a letter which made me realise it might be
necessary to follow every word of the trial.
However much I tried to convince myself I should explain why I couldn't do it, I knew I wouldn't be able
to resist it.
That same morning, a Friday- I suppose these things always happen on a Friday- I was called in for
what I assumed was to be a routine weekly meeting with the managing director, only to be informed that
the company no longer needed me.
"Frankly, in the last few months your work has gone from bad to worse," I was told.
I didn't feel able to disagree with him.
"And you have left me with no choice but to replace you."
A polite way of saying, "You're sacked."
"Your desk will be cleared by five this evening," the managing director continued, "when you will receive
a cheque from the accounts department for ï¿½17,500."
I raised an eyebrow.
"Six months' compensation, as stipulated in your contract when we took over the company," he
explained.
When the managing director stretched out his hand it was not to wish me luck, but to ask for the keys of
my Rover.
I remember my first thought when he informed me of his decision: at least I would be able to attend
every day of the trial without any hassle.
Elizabethtook the news of my sacking badly but only asked what plans I had for finding a new job.
During the next month I pretended to look for a position in another company but realised I couldn't hope
to settle down to anything until the case was over.
On the morning of the trial all the popular papers had colourful background pieces. The Daily Express
even displayed on its front page a flattering picture of Carla in a swimsuit on the beach atMarbella: I
wondered how much her sister in Fulham had been paid for that particular item. Alongside it was a
profile photo of Paul Menzies which made him look as if he were already a convict.
I was amongst the first to be told in which court at the Old Bailey the case of the Crown v. Menzies
would be tried. A uniformed policeman gave me detailed directions and along with several others I made
my way to Court No. 4.
Once I had reached the courtroom I filed in and made sure that I sat on the end of my row. I looked
round thinking everyone would stare at me, but to my relief no one showed the slightest interest.
I had a good view of the defendant as he stood in the dock. Menzies was a frail man who looked as if
he had recently lost a lot of weight; fifty-one, the newspapers had said, but he looked nearer seventy. I
began to wonder how much I must have aged over the past few months.
Menzies wore a smart, dark blue suit that hung loosely on him, a clean shirt and what I thought must be
a regimental tie. His grey thinning hair was swept straight back; a small silver moustache gave him a
military air. He certainly didn't look like a murderer or much of a catch as a lover, but anyone glancing
towards me would probably have come to the same conclusion. I searched around the sea of faces for
Mrs Menzies but no one in the court fitted the newspaper description of her.
We all rose when Mr Justice Buchanan came in.
"The Crown v. Menzies," the clerk of the court read out.
The judge leaned forward to tell Menzies that he could be seated and then turned slowly towards the
jury box.
He explained that, although there had been considerable press interest in the case, their opinion was all
that mattered because they alone would be asked to decide if the prisoner were guilty or not guilty of
murder. He also advised the jury against reading any newspaper articles concerning the trial or listening to
anyone else's views, especially those who had not been present in court: such people, he said, were
always the first to have an immutable opinion on what the verdict should be. He went on to remind the
jury how important it was to concentrate on the evidence because a man's life was at stake. I found
myself nodding in agreement.
I glanced round the court hoping there was nobody there who would recognise me. Menzies's eyes
remained fixed firmly on the judge, who was turning back to face the prosecuting counsel.
Even as Sir Humphrey Mountcliff rose from his place on the bench I was thankful he was against
Menzies and not me. A man of dominating height with a high forehead and silver grey hair, he
commanded the court not only with his physical presence but with a voice that was never less than
authoritative.
To a silent assembly he spent the rest of the morning setting out the case for the prosecution. His eyes
rarely left the jury box except occasionally to peer down at his notes.
He reconstructed the events as heimagined they had happened that evening in April.
The opening address lasted two and a half hours, shorter than I'd expected. The judge then suggested a
break for lunch and asked us all to be back in our places byten past two.
After lunch Sir Humphrey called his first witness, Detective Inspector Simmons. I was unable to look
directly at the policeman while he presented his evidence. Each reply he gave was as if he were
addressing me personally. I wondered if he suspected all along that there was another man. Simmons
gave a highly professional account ofhimself as he described in detail how they had found the body and
later traced Menzies through two witnesses and the damning parking ticket. By the time Sir Humphrey
sat down few people in that court could have felt that Simmons had arrested the wrong man.
Menzies's defence counsel, who rose to cross-examine the Detective Inspector, could not have been in
greater contrast to Sir Humphrey. Mr Robert Scott, QC, was short and stocky, with thick bushy
eyebrows. He spoke slowly and without inflection. I was happy to observe that one member of the jury
was having difficulty in staying awake.
For the next twenty minutes Scott took the Detective Inspector painstakingly back over his evidence
but was unable to make Simmons retract anything substantial. As the Inspector stepped out of the
witness box I felt confident enough to look him straight in the eye.
The next witness was a Home Office pathologist, Dr Anthony Mallins, who, after answering a few
preliminary questions to establish hisprofessional status , moved on to answer an inquiry from Sir
Humphrey that took everyone by surprise. The pathologist informed the court that there was clear
evidence to suggest that Miss Moorland had had sexual intercourse shortly before her death.
"How can you be so certain, Dr Mallins?"
"Because I found traces of blood group B on the deceased's upper thigh, while Miss Moorland was
later found to be blood group 0. There were also traces of seminal fluid on the negligee she was wearing
at the time of her death."
"Are these common blood groups?" Sir Humphrey asked.
"Blood group O is common," Dr Mallins admitted. "Group B. however, is fairly unusual."
"And what would you say was the cause of her death?" Sir Humphrey asked.
"A blow or blows to the head, which caused a broken jaw, and lacerations at the base of the skull
which may have been delivered by a blunt instrument."
I wanted to stand up and say, "I can tell you which!" when Sir Humphrey said, "Thank you, Dr Mallins.
No more questions. Please wait there."
Mr Scott treated the doctor with far more respect than he had Inspector Simmons, despite Mallins
being the defendant's witness.
"Could the blow on the back of Miss Moorland's head have been caused by a fall?" he asked.
The doctor hesitated. "Possibly," he agreed. "But that wouldn't explain the broken jaw."
Mr Scott ignored the comment and pressed on.
"What percentage of people inBritainare blood groupB?"
"About five, six per cent," volunteered the doctor.
"Two and a half million people," said Mr Scott, and waited for the figure to sink in before he suddenly
changed tack.
But as hard as he tried he could not shift the pathologist on the time of death or on the fact that sexual
intercourse must have taken place around the hours his client had been with Carla.
When Mr Scott sat down the judge asked Sir Humphrey if he wished to re-examine.
"I do, my Lord. Dr Mallins, you told the court that Miss Moorland suffered from a broken jaw and
lacerations on the back of her head. Could the lacerations have been caused by falling on to a blunt
object after the jaw had been broken?"
"I must object, my Lord," said Mr Scott, rising with unusual speed. "This is a leading question."
Mr Justice Buchanan leaned forward and peered down at the doctor. "I agree, Mr Scott, but I would
like to know if Dr Mallins found blood group 0, Miss Moorland's blood group, on any other object in the
room?"
"Yes, my Lord'" replied the doctor."On the edge of the glass table in the centre of the room."
"Thank you, Dr Mallins," said Sir Humphrey. "No more questions."
' Sir Humphrey's next witness was MrsRita Johnson , the lady who claimed she had seen everything.
"Mrs Johnson, on the evening of April 7th, did you see a man leave the block of flats where Miss
Moorland lived?" Sir Humphrey asked.
"Yes, I did."
"At about what time was that?"
"A few minutes after six."
"Please tell the court what happened next."
"He walked across the road, removed a parking ticket, got into his car and drove away."
"Do you see that man in the court today?"
"Yes," she said firmly, pointing to Menzies, who at this suggestion shook his head vigorously.
"No more questions."
Mr Scott rose slowly again.
"What did you say was the make of the car the man got into?"
"I can't be sure," Mrs Johnson said, "but I think it was a BMW."
"Not a Rover as you first told the police the following morning?"
The witness did not reply.
"And did you actually see the man in question remove a parking ticket from the car windscreen?" Mr
Scott asked.
"I think so, sir, but it all happened so quickly."
"I'm sure it did," said Mr Scott. "In fact, I suggest to you that it happened so quickly that you've got the
wrong man and the wrong car."
"No, sir," she replied, but without the same conviction with which she had delivered her earlier replies.
Sir Humphrey did not re-examine Mrs Johnson. I realised that he wanted her evidence to be forgotten
by the jury as quickly as possible. As it was, when she left the witness box she also left everyone in court
in considerable doubt.
Carla's daily, Maria Lucia, was far more convincing. She stated unequivocally that she hadseen Menzies
in the living roomofthe flat that afternoon when she arrived a little before five. However, she had, she
admitted, never seen him before that day.
"But isn't it true," asked Sir Humphrey, "that you usually only work in the mornings?"
"Yes," she replied. "Although Miss Moorland was in the habit of bringing work home on a Thursday
afternoon so it was convenient for me to come in and collect my wages."
"And how was Miss Moorland dressed that afternoon?" asked Sir Humphrey.
"In her blue morning coat," replied the daily.
"Is this how she usually dressed on a Thursday afternoon?"
"No, sir, but I assumed she was going to have a bath before going out that evening."
"But when you left the flatwas she still with Mr Menzies?"
"Yes, sir."
"Do you remember anything else she was wearing that day?"
"Yes, sir.Underneath the morning coat she wore a red negligee."
My negligee was duly produced and Maria Lucia identified it. At this point I stared directly at the
witness but she showed not a flicker of recognition. I thanked all the gods in the Pantheon that I had
never once been to visit Carla in the morning.
"Please wait there," were Sir Humphrey's final words to Miss Lucia.
Mr Scott rose to cross-examine.
"Miss Lucia, you have told the court that the purpose of the visit was to collect your wages. How long
were you at the flat on this occasion?"
"I did a little clearing up in the kitchen and ironed a blouse, perhaps twenty minutes."
"Did you see Miss Moorland during this time?"
"Yes, I went into the drawing room to ask if she would like some more coffee but she said no."
"Was Mr Menzies with her at the time?"
"Yes, he was."
"Were you at any time aware of a quarrel between the two of them or even raised voices?"
"No, sir."
"When you saw them together did Miss Moorland show any signs of distress or need of help?"
"No, sir."
"Then what happened?"
"Miss Moorland joined me in the kitchen a few minutes later, gave me my wages and I let myself out."
"When you were alone in the kitchen with Miss Moorland, did she give any sign of being afraid of her
guest?"
"No, sir."
"No more questions, my Lord."
Sir Humphrey did not re-examine Maria Lucia and informed the judge that he had completed the case
for the prosecution. Mr Justice Buchanan nodded and said he felt that was enough for the day; but I
wasn't convinced it was enough to convict Menzies.
When I got home that nightElizabethdid not ask me where I had been, and I did not volunteer any
information. I spent the evening pretending to go over job applications.
The following morning I had a late breakfast and read the papers before returning to my place at the end
of a row in Court No. 4, only a few moments before the judge made his entrance.
Mr Justice Buchanan, having sat down, adjusted his wig before calling on Mr Scott to open the case for
the defence. Mr Scott, QC, was once again slow to rise - a man-paid by the hour, I thought uncharitably.
He started by promising the court that his opening address would be brief, and he then remained on his
feet for the next two and a half hours.
He began the case for the defence by going over in detail the relevant parts, as he saw them, of
Menzies's past. He assured us all that those who wished to dissect it later would only find an unblemished
record. Paul Menzies was a happily married man who lived in Sutton with his wife and three children,
Polly, aged twenty-one, Michael, nineteen, and Sally, sixteen. Two of the children were now at university
and the youngest had just completed her GCSE. Doctors had advised Mrs Menzies not to attend the
trial, following her recent release from hospital. I noticed two of the women on the jury smile
sympathetically.
Mr Menzies, Mr Scott continued, had been with the same firm of insurance brokers in the City of
Londonfor the past six years and, although he had not been promoted, he was a much respected member
of the staff. He was a pillar of his local community, having served with the Territorial Army and on the
committee of the local camera club. He had once even stood for the Sutton council. He could hardly be
described as a serious candidate as a murderer.
Mr Scott then went on to the actual day of the killing and confirmed that Mr Menzies had an
appointment with Miss Moorland on the afternoon in question, but in a strictly professional capacity with
the sole purpose of helping her with a personal insurance plan. There could have been no other reason to
visit Miss Moorland during office hours. He did not have sexual intercourse with her and he certainly did
not murder her.
The defendant had left his client a few minutes after six. He understood she had intended to change
before going out to dinner with her sister in Fulham. He had arranged to seeher the following Wednesday
at his of lice for the purpose of drawing up the completed policy. The defence, Mr Scott went on, would
later produce a diary entry that would establish the truth of this statement.
The charge against the accused was, he submitted, based almost completely on circumstantial evidence.
He felt confident that, when the trial reached its conclusion, the jury would be left with no choice but to
release his client back into the bosom of his loving family. "You must end this nightmare," Mr Scott
concluded. "It has gone on far too long for an innocent man."
At this point the judge suggested a break for lunch. During the meal I was unable to concentrate or even
take in what was being said around me. The majority of those who had an opinion to give now seemed
convinced that Menzies was innocent.
As soon as we returned, atten past two, Mr Scott called his first witness: the defendant himself.
Paul Menzies left the dock and walked slowly over to the witness box. He took a copy of theNew
Testament in his right hand and haltingly read the words of the oath, from a card which he held in his left.
Every eye was fixed on him while Mr Scott began to guide his client carefully through the minefield of
evidence.
Menzies became progressively more confident in his delivery as the day wore on, and when atfour thirty
the judge told the court, "That's enough for today," I was convinced that he would get off, even if only by
a majority verdict.
I spent a fitful night before returning to my place on the third day fearing the worst. Would Menzies be
released and would they then start looking for me?
Mr Scott opened the third morning as gently as he had begun the second, but he repeated so many
questions from the previous day that it became obvious he was only steadying his client in preparation for
prosecuting counsel. Before he finally sat down he asked Menzies for a third time, "Did you ever have
sexual intercourse with Miss Moorland?"
"No, sir.I had only met her for the first time that day," Menzies replied firmly.
"And did you murder Miss Moorland?"
"Certainly not, sir," said Menzies, his voice now strong and confident.
Mr Scott resumed his place, a look of quiet satisfaction on his face.
In fairness to Menzies, very little which takes place in normal life could have prepared anyone for
cross-examination by Sir Humphrey Mountcliff. I could not have asked for a better advocate.
"I'd like to start, if I may, Mr Menzies," he began, "with what your counsel seems to set great store by
as proof of your innocence."
Menzies's thin lips remained in a firm straight line.
"The pertinent entry in your diary which suggests that you made a second appointment to see Miss
Moorland, the murdered woman" - three words Sir Humphrey was to repeat again and again during his
cross-examination - "for the Wednesday after she had been killed."
"Yes, sir," said Menzies.
"This entry was made - correct me if I'm wrong - following your Thursday meeting at Miss Moorland's
flat."
"Yes, sir," said Menzies, obviously tutored not to add anything that might later help prosecuting counsel.
"So when did you make that entry?" Sir Humphrey asked.
"On the Friday morning."
"After Miss Moorland had been killed?"
"Yes, but I didn't know."
"Do you carry a diary on you, Mr Menzies?"
"Yes, but only a small pocket diary, not my large desk one."
"Do you have it with you today?"
"I do."
"May I be allowed to see it?"
Reluctantly Menzies took a small green diary out of his jacket pocket and handed it over to the clerk of
the court, who in turn passed it on to Sir Humphrey. Sir Humphrey began to leaf through the pages.
"I see that there is no entry for your appointment with Miss Moorland for the afternoon on which she
was murdered?"
"No, sir," said Menzies. "I put office appointments only in my deskdiary, personal appointments are
restricted to my pocket diary."
"I understand," said Sir Humphrey. He paused and looked up. "But isn't it strange, Mr Menzies, that
you agreed to an appointment with a client to discuss further business and you then trusted it to memory,
when you so easily could have put it in the diary you carry around with you all the time before transferring
it?"
"I might have written it down on a slip of paper at the time, but as I explained that's a personal diary."
"Is it?" said Sir Humphrey as he flicked back a few more pages. "Who is David Paterson?" he asked.
Menzies looked as if he were trying to place him.
"Mr David Paterson,112 City Road, 11.30, January 9th this year," Sir Humphrey read out to the court.
Menzies looked anxious. "We could subpoena Mr Paterson if you can't recall the meeting," said Sir
Humphrey helpfully.
"He's a client of my firm," said Menzies in a quiet voice.
"A client of your firm," Sir Humphrey repeated slowly. "I wonder how many of those I could find if I
went through your diary at a more leisurelypace? " Menzies bowed his head as Sir Humphrey passed the
diary back to the clerk, having made his point.
"Now I should like to turn to some more important questions . . ."
"Not until after lunch, Sir Humphrey,"the judge intervened. "It's nearly one and I think we'll take a break
now."
"As you wish, my Lord," came back the courteous reply.
I left the court in a more optimistic mood, even though I couldn't wait to discover what could be more
important than that diary. Sir Humphrey's emphasis on little lies, although they did not prove Menzies was
a murderer, did show he was hiding something. I became anxious that during the break Mr Scott might
advise Menzies to admit to his affair with Carla, and thus make the rest of his story appear more credible.
To my relief, over the meal I learned that under English law Menzies could not consult his counsel while
he was still in the witness box. I noticed when we returned to court that Mr Scott's smile had
disappeared.
Sir Humphrey rose to continue his cross examination.
"You have stated under oath, Mr Menzies, that you are a happily married man."
"I am, sir," said the defendant with feeling.
"Was your first marriage as happy, Mr Menzies?" asked Sir Humphrey casually. The defendant's
cheeks drained of their colour. I quickly looked over towards Mr Scott who could not mask that this
was information with which he had not been entrusted.
"Take your time before you answer," said Sir Humphrey.
All eyes turned to the man in the witness box.
"No," said Menzies and quickly added, "butI was very young at the time. It was many years ago and all
a ghastly mistake."
"All a ghastly mistake?" repeated Sir Humphrey, looking straight at the jury. "And how did that
marriage end?"
"In divorce," Menzies said quite simply.
"And what were the grounds for that divorce?"
"Cruelty," said Menzies, "but. . ."
"But . . . would you like me to read out to the jury what your first wife swore under oath in court that
day?"
Menzies stood there shaking. He knew that "No" would damn him and "Yes" would hang him.
"Well, as you seem unable to advise us I will, with your permission, my Lord, read the statement made
before Mr Justice Rodger on dune 9th, 1961, at the Swindon County Court by the first Mrs Menzies."
Sir Humphrey cleared his throat. "'He used to hit me again and again, and it became so bad that I had to
run away for fear he might one day kill me."' Sir Humphrey emphasised the last five words.
"She was exaggerating," shouted Menzies from the witness box.
"How unfortunate that poor Miss Carla Moorland cannot be with us today to let us know if your story
about her is also an exaggeration."
"I object, my Lord," said Mr Scott. "Sir Humphrey is harassing the witness."
"I agree," said the judge. "Tread more carefully in future, Sir Humphrey."
"I apologise, my Lord," said Sir Humphrey, sounding singularly unapologetic. He dosed the file to which
he had been referring and replaced it on the desk in front of him before taking up anew one . He opened
it slowly, making sure all in the court were following every movement before he extracted a single sheet
of paper.
"How many mistresses have you had since you were married to the second Mrs Menzies?"
"Objection, my Lord. How can this be relevant?"
"My Lord, it is relevant, I respectfully suggest. I intend to show that this was not a business relationship
that Mr Menzies was conducting with Miss Moorland but a highly personal one."
"The question can be put to the defendant," ruled the judge.
Menzies said nothing as Sir Humphrey held up the sheet of paper in front of him and studied it.
"Take your time because I want the exact number," Sir Humphrey said, looking over the top of his
glasses.
The seconds ticked on as we all waited.
"Hm- three, I think," Menzies said eventually in a voice that just carried. The gentlemen of the press
began scribbling furiously.
"Three," said Sir Humphrey, staring at his piece of paper in disbelief.
"Well, perhaps four."
"And was the fourth Miss Carla Moorland?" Sir Humphrey asked."Because you had sexual intercourse
with her that evening, didn't you?"
"No, I did not," said Menzies, but by this time few in that courtroom could have believed him.
"Very well then," continued Sir Humphrey, as he placed the piece of paper on the bench in front of him.
"But before I return to your relationshipwith Miss Moorland, let us discover the truth about the other
four."
I stared at the piece of paper from which Sir Humphrey had been reading. From where I was seated I
could see that there was nothing written on it at all. A blank white sheet lay before him.
I was finding it hard to keep a grin off my face. Menzies's adulterous background was an unexpected
bonus for me and the press - and I couldn't help wondering how Carla would have reacted if she had
known about it.
Sir Humphrey spent the rest of the day making Menzies relate the details of his previous relationships
with the four mistresses. The court was agog and the journalists continued to scribble away, knowing
they were about to have a field day. When the court rose Mr Scott's eyes were closed.
I drove home that night feeling not a little pleased with myself; like a man who had just completed a
good day's work.
On entering the courtroom the following morning I noticed people were beginning to acknowledge other
regulars and nod. I found myself falling into the same pattern and greeted people silently as I took my
regular position on the end of the bench.
Sir Humphrey spent the morning going over some of Menzies's other misdemeanours. We discovered
that he had served in the Territorial Army for only five months and left after a misunderstanding with his
commanding officer over how many hours he should have been spending on exercises during weekends
and how much he had claimed in expenses for those hours. We also learned that his attempts to get on
the local council sprung more from anger at being refused planning permission to build on a piece of land
adjoining his house than from an altruistic desire to serve his fellow men. To be fair, Sir Humphrey could
have made the Archangel Gabriel look like a soccer hooligan; but his trump card was still to come.
"Mr Menzies, I should now like to return to your version of what happened on the night Miss Moorland
was killed."
"Yes,"sighed Menzies in a tired voice.
"When you visit a client to discuss one of your policies, how long would you say such a consultation
usually lasts?"
"Usually half an hour, an hour at the most," said Menzies.
"And how long did the consultation with Miss Moorland take?"
"A good hour," said Menzies.
"And you left her, if I remember your evidence correctly, a little aftersix o'clock."
"That is correct."
"And what time was your appointment?"
"Atfive o'clock, as was shown clearly in my desk diary," said Menzies.
"Well, Mr Menzies, if you arrived at about five to keep your appointment with Miss Moorland and left a
little after six, how did you manage to get a parking fine?"
"I didn't have any small change for the meter at the time," said Menzies confidently. "As I was already a
couple of minutes late, I just risked it."
"You just risked it," repeated Sir Humphrey slowly. "You are obviously a man who takes risks, Mr
Menzies. I wonder if you would be goodenough to look at the parking ticket in question."
The clerk handed it up to Menzies.
"Would you read out to the court the hour and minute that the traffic warden has written in the little
boxes to show when the offence occurred."
Once again Menzies took a long time to reply.
"Four sixteen to four thirty," he said eventually.
"I didn't hear that," said the judge.
"Would you be kind enough to repeat what you said for the judge?" Sir Humphrey asked.
Menzies repeated the damning figures.
"So now we have established that you were in fact with Miss Moorland some time beforefour sixteen,
and not, as I suggest you later wrote in your diary,five o'clock. That was just another lie, wasn't it?"
"No," said Menzies. "I must have arrived a little earlier than I realised."
"At least an hour earlier, it seems. And I also suggest to you that you arrived at that early hour because
your interest in Carla Moorland was not simply professional?"
"That's not true."
"Then it wasn't your intention that she should become your mistress?"
Menzies hesitated long enough for Sir Humphrey to answer his own question. "Because the business
part of your meeting finished in the usual half hour, did it not, Mr Menzies?" He waited for a response but
still none was forthcoming.
"What is your blood group, Mr Menzies?"
"I have no idea."
Sir Humphrey without warning changed tack: "Have you heard of DNA, by any chance?"
"No," came back the puzzled reply.
"Deoxyribonucleic acid is a proven technique that shows genetic information can be unique to every
individual. Blood or semen samples can be matched. Semen, Mr Menzies, is as unique as any fingerprint.
With such a sample we would know immediately if you raped Miss Moorland."
"I didn't rape her," Menzies said indignantly.
"Nevertheless sexual intercourse did take place, didn't it?" said Sir Humphrey quietly.
Menzies remained silent.
"Shall I recall the Home Office pathologist and ask him to carry out a DNA test?"
Menzies still made no reply.
"And check your blood group?" Sir Humphrey paused. "I will ask you once again, Mr Menzies. Did
sexual intercourse between you and the murdered woman take place that Thursday afternoon?"
"Yes, sir," said Menzies in a whisper.
"Yes, sir," repeated Sir Humphrey so that the whole court could hear it.
"But it wasn't rape," Menzies shouted back at Sir Humphrey.
"Wasn't it?" said Sir Humphrey.
"And I swear I didn't kill her."
I must have been the only person in that courtroom who knew he was telling the truth. All Sir Humphrey
said was; "No more questions, my Lord."
Mr Scott tried manfully to resurrect his client's credibility during re-examination but the fact that Menzies
had been caught lying about his relationship with Carla made everything he had said previously appear
doubtful.
If only Menzies had told the truth aboutbeing Carla's lover, his story might well have been accepted. I
wondered why he had gone through the charade- in order to protect hiswife? Whatever the motive, it
had only ended by making him appear guilty of a crime he hadn't committed.
I went home that night and ate the largest meal I had had for several days.
The following morning Mr Scott called two more witnesses. The first turned out to be the vicar of St
Peter's, Sutton, who was there as a character witness to prove what a pillar of the community Menzies
was. After Sir Humphrey had finished his cross-examination the vicar ended up looking like a rather kind,
unworldly old man, whose knowledge of Menzies was based on the latter's occasional attendance at
Sunday matins.
The second was Menzies's superior at the company they both worked for in the City. He was a far
more impressive figure but he was unable to confirm that Miss Moorland had ever been a client of the
company.
Mr Scott put up no more witnesses and informed Mr Justice Buchanan that he had completed the case
for the defence. The judge nodded and, turning to Sir Humphrey, told him he would not be required to
begin his final address until the following morning.
That heralded the signal for the court to rise.
Another long evening and an even longer night had to be endured by Menzies and myself. As on every
other day during the trial, I made sure I was in my place the next morning before the judge entered.
Sir Humphrey's closing speech was masterful.
Every little untruth was logged so that one began to accept that very little of Menzies's testimony could
be relied on.
"We will never know for certain," said Sir Humphrey, "for what reason poor young Carla Moorland
was murdered.Refusal to succumb to Menzies's advances? A fit of temper which ended with a blow that
caused her to fall and later die alone? But there are, however, some things, members of the jury, of which
we can be quite certain.
"We can be certain that Menzies was with the murdered woman that day before the hour offour sixteen
because of the evidence of the damning parking ticket.
"We can be certain that he left a little after six because we have a witness who saw him drive away, and
he does not himself deny this evidence.
"And we can be certain that he wrote a false entry in his diary to make you believe he had a business
appointment with the murdered woman at five, rather than a personal assignation some time before.
"And we can now be certain that he lied about having sexual intercourse with Miss Moorland a short
time before she was killed, though we cannot be certain if intercourse took place before or after her jaw
had been broken." Sir Humphrey's eyes rested on the jury before he continued.
"We can, finally, establish, beyond reasonable doubt, from the pathologist's report, the time of death
and that, therefore, Menzies was the last person who could possibly have seen Carla Moorland alive.
"Therefore no one else could have killedCarla Moorland - for do not forget Inspector Simmons's
evidence - and if you accept that, you can be in no doubt that only Menzies could have been responsible
for her death. And how damning you must have found it that he tried to hide the existence of a first wife
who had left him on the grounds of his cruelty, and the four mistresses who left him we know not why or
how. Only one less than Bluebeard," Sir Humphrey added with feeling.
"For the sake of every young girl who lives on her own in our capital, you must carry out your duty,
however painful that duty might be. And find Menzies guilty of murder."
When Sir Humphrey sat down I wanted to applaud.
The judge sent us away for another break. Voices all around me were now damning Menzies. I listened
contentedly without offering an opinion. I knew that if the jury convicted Menzies the file would be closed
and no eyes would ever be turned in my direction. I was seated in my place before the judge appeared at
ten past two. He called on Mr Scott.
Menzies's counsel put up a spirited defence of his client, pointing out that almost all the evidence that Sir
Humphrey had come up with had been circumstantial, and that it was even possible someone else could
have visited Carla Moorland after his client had left that night. Mr Scott's bushy eyebrows seemed almost
to have a life of their own as he energetically emphasised that it was the prosecution's responsibility to
prove their case beyond reasonable doubt and not his to disprove it, and that, in his opinion, his learned
friend, Sir Humphrey, had failed to do so.
During his summing-up Scott avoided any mention of diary entries, parking tickets, past mistresses,
sexual intercourse or questions of his client's role in the community. A latecomer listen-ing only to the
closing speeches might have been forgiven for thinking the two learned gentlemen were summarising
different cases.
Mr Scott's expression became grim as he turned to face the jury for his summation. "The twelve of you,"
he said, "hold the fate of my client in your hands. You must, therefore, be certain, I repeat, certain
beyond reasonable doubt that Paul Menzies could have committed such an evil crime as murder.
"This is not a trial about Mr Menzies's lifestyle, his position in the community or even his sexual habits. If
adultery were a crime I feel confident Mr Menzies would not be the only person in this courtroom to be
in the dock today." He paused as his eyes swept up and down the jury.
"For this reason I feel confident that you will find it in your hearts to release my client from the torment
he has been put through during the last seven months. He has surely been shown to be an innocent man
deserving of your compassion."
Mr Scott sank down on the bench having, I felt, given his client a glimmer of hope.
The judge told us that he would not begin his own summing-up until Monday morning.
The weekend seemed interminable to me. By Monday I had convinced myself that enough members of
the jury would feel there just had not been sufficient evidence to convict.
As soon as the trial was under way the judge began by explaining once again that it was the jury alone
who must make the ultimate decision. It was not his job to let them know how he felt, but only to advise
them on the law.
He went back over all the evidence, trying to put it in perspective, but he never gave as much as a hint
as to his own opinions. When he had completed his summing-up late that afternoon he sent the jury away
to consider their verdict.
I waited with nearly as much anxiety as Menzies must have done while I listened to others giving their
opinion as the minutes ticked by in that little room. Then, four hours later, a note was sent up to the
judge.
He immediately asked the jury to return to their places while the press flooded back into the courtroom,
making it look like the House of Commons on Budget Day. The clerk dutifully handed up the note
to Mr Justice Buchanan. He opened it and read what only twelve other people in the courtroom could
have known.
He handed it back to the clerk who then read the note to a silent court.
Mr Justice Buchanan frowned before asking if there were any chance of a unanimous verdict being
reached if he allowed more time. Once he had learned that it was proving impossible he reluctantly
nodded his agreement to a majority verdict.
The jury disappeared downstairs again to continue their deliberations, and did not return to their places
for another three hours. I could sense the tension in the court as neighbours sought to give opinions to
each other in noisy whispers. The clerk called for silence asthejudge waited for everyone to settle before
he instructed the clerk to proceed.
When the clerk rose, I could hear the person next to me breathing.
"Would the Foreman please stand?"
I rose from my place.
"Have you reached a verdict on which at least ten of you are agreed?"
"We have, sir."
"Do you find the defendant, Paul Menzies, guilty or not guilty?"
"Guilty," I replied.
CLEAN SWEEP IGNATIUS
FEW showed much interest when IgnatiusAgarbi was appointedNigeria's Minister of Finance.
After all, the cynics pointed out, he was the seventeenth person to hold the office in seventeen years.
In Ignatius's first major policy statement to Parliament he promised to end graft and corruption in public
life and warned the electorate that no one holding an official position could feel safe unless he led a
blameless life. He ended his maiden speech with the words, "I intend to clear outNigeria's Augean
stables."
Such was the impact of the minister's speech that it failed to get a mention in the Lagos Daily Times.
Perhaps the editor considered that, since the paper had covered the speeches of the previous sixteen
ministers inextenso , his readers might feel they had heard it all before.
Ignatius, however, was not to be disheartened by the lack of confidence shown in him, and set about his
new task with vigour and determination. Within days of his appointment he had caused a minor official at
the Ministry of Trade to bejailed for falsifying documents relating to the import of grain. The next to feel
the bristles of Ignatius's new broom was a leading Lebanese financier, who was deported without trial for
breach of the exchange control regulations. A month later came an event which even Ignatius considered
a personal coup: the arrest of the Inspector General of Police for accepting bribes - a perk the citizens of
Lagoshad in the past considered went withthejob . When four months later the Police Chief was
sentenced to eighteen months in jail, the new Finance Minister finally made the front page of the Lagos
Daily Times. A leader on the centre page dubbed him "Clean Sweep Ignatius", the new broom every
guilty man feared. Ignatius's reputation as Mr Clean continued to grow as arrest followed arrest and
unfounded rumours began circulating in the capital that even General Otobi, the Head of State, was under
investigation by his own Finance Minister.
Ignatius alone now checked, vetted and authorised all foreign contracts worth over one hundred million
dollars. And although every decision he made was meticulously scrutinized by his enemies, not a breath
of scandal ever became associated with his name.
When Ignatius began his second year of office as Minister of Finance even the cynics began to
acknowledge his achievements. It was about this time that General Otobi felt confident enough to call
Ignatius in for an unscheduled consultation.
The Head of State welcomed the Minister to Dodan Barracks and ushered him to a comfortable chair
in his study overlooking the parade ground.
"Ignatius, I have just finished going over the latest budget report and I am alarmed by your conclusion
that the Exchequer is still losing millions of dollars each year in bribes paid to go-betweens by foreign
companies. Have you any idea into whose pockets this money is falling? That's what I want to know."
Ignatius sat bolt upright, his eyes never leaving the Head of State.
"I suspect a great percentage of the money is ending up in private Swiss bank accounts but I am at
present unable to prove it."
"Then I will give you whatever added authority you require to do so," said General Otobi. "You can use
any means you consider necessary to ferret out these villains. Start by investigating every member of my
Cabinet, past and present. And show no fear or favour in your endeavours, no matter what their rank or
connections."
"For such a task to have any chance of success I would need a special letter of authority signed by you,
General . . ."
"Then it will be on your desk bysix o'clockthis evening," said the Head of State.
"And the rank of Ambassador Plenipotentiary whenever I travel abroad."
"Granted."
"Thank you," said Ignatius, rising from his chair on the assumption that the audience was over.
"You may also need this," said the General as they walked towards the door. The Head of State
handed Ignatius a small automatic pistol. "Because I suspect by now that you have almost as many
enemies as I."
Ignatius took the pistol from the soldier awkwardly, put it in his pocket and mumbled his thanks.
Without another word passing between the two men Ignatius left his leader and was driven back to his
Ministry.
Without the knowledge of the Governor of the Central Bank ofNigeriaand unhindered by any senior
civil servants, Ignatius enthusiastically set about his new task. He researched alone at night, and by day
discussed his findings with no one. Three months later he was ready to pounce.
The Minister selected the month of August to make an unscheduled visit abroad as it was the time when
most Nigerians went on holiday and his absence would therefore not be worthy of comment.
He asked his Permanent Secretary to book him, his wife and their two children on a flight toOrlando,
and to be certain that it was charged to his personal account.
On their arrival inFloridathe family checked into the local Marriott Hotel. He then informed his wife,
without warning or explanation, that he would be spending a few days inNew Yorkon business before
rejoining them for the rest of the holiday. The following morning Ignatius left his family to the mysteries of
Disney World while he took a flight toNew York. It was a short taxi ride from La Guardia to Kennedy,
where, after a change of clothes and the purchase of a return tourist ticket for cash, Ignatius boarded a
Swissair flight forGenevaunobserved.
Once in the Swiss capital Ignatius booked into an inconspicuous hotel, retired to bed andslept soundly
for eight hours. Over breakfast the following morning he studied the list of banks he had so carefully
drawn up after completing his research inNigeria: each name was written out boldly in his own hand.
Ignatius decided to start with Gerberet Cie whose building, he observed from the hotel bedroom, took
up half the Avenue de Parchine. He checked the telephone number with the concierge before placing a
call. The chairman agreed to see him attwelve o'clock.
Carrying only a battered briefcase, Ignatius arrived at the bank a few minutes before the appointed
hour- an unusual occurrence for a Nigerian, thought the young man dressed in a smart grey suit, white
shirt and grey silk tie,who was waiting in the marble hall to greet him. He bowed to the Minister,
introducing himself as the chairman's personal assistant, and explained that he would accompany Ignatius
to the chairman's office. The young executive led the Minister to a waiting lift and neither man uttered
another word until they had reached the eleventh floor. A gentle tap on the chairman's door elicited "
Entrez," which the young man obeyed.
"The Nigerian Minister of Finance, sir."
The chairman rose from behind his desk and stepped forward to greet his guest. Ignatius could not help
noticing that he too wore a grey suit, white shirt and grey silk tie.
"Good morning, Minister," the chairman said. "Won't you have a seat?" He ushered Ignatius towards a
low glass table surrounded by comfortable chairs on the far side of the room. "I have ordered coffee for
both of us if that is acceptable."
Ignatius nodded, placed the battered briefcase on the floor by the side of his chair and stared out of the
large plate-glass window. He made some smallltalk about the splendid view of the magnificent fountain
while a girl served all three men with coffee.
Once the young woman had left the room Ignatius got down to business.
"My Head of State has requested that I visit your bank with a rather unusual request," he began. Not a
flicker of surprise appeared on the face of the chairman or his young assistant. "He has honoured me with
the task of discovering which Nigerian citizens hold numbered accounts with your bank."
On learning this piece of information only the chairman's lips moved. "I am not at liberty to disclose -"
"Allow me to put my case," said the Minister, raising a white palm. "First, let me assure you that I come
with the absolute authority of my government." Without another word, Ignatius extracted an envelope
from his inside pocket with a flourish. He handed it to the chairman who removed the letter inside and
read it slowly.
Once he had finished reading, the banker cleared his throat. "This document, I fear, sir, carries no
validity in my country." He replaced it in the envelope and handed it back to Ignatius. "I am, of course,"
continued the chairman, "not for one moment doubting that you have the full backing of your Head of
State, both as a Minister and an Ambassador, but that does not change the bank's rule of confidentiality
in such matters. There are no circumstances in which we would releasethe names of any of our account
holders without their authority. I'm sorry to be of so little help, but those are, and will always remain, the
bank rules." The chairman rose to his feet, as he considered the meeting was now at an end; but he had
not bargained for Clean Sweep Ignatius.
"My Head of State," said Ignatius, softening his tone perceptibly, "has authorized me to approach your
bank to act as the intermediary for all future transactions between my country andSwitzerland."
"We are flattered by your confidence in us, Minister," replied the chairman, who remained standing.
"However, I feel sure that you will understand that it cannot alter our attitude to our customers'
confidentiality."
Ignatius remained unperturbed.
"Then I am sorry to inform you, Mr Gerber, that our Ambassador inGenevawill be instructed to make
an official communiquï¿½ to the Swiss Foreign Office about the lack of co-operation your bank has shown
concerning requests for information about our nationals." He waited for his words to sink in. "You could
avoid such embarrassment, of course, by simply letting me know the names of my countrymen who hold
accounts with Gerberet Cie and the amounts involved. I can assure you we would not reveal the source
of our information."
"You are most welcome to lodge such a communiquï¿½, sir, and I feel sure that our Minister will explain
to your Ambassador in the most courteous of diplomatic language that the Foreign Ministry does not
have the authority under Swiss law to demand such disclosures."
"If that is the case, I shall instruct myown Ministry of Trade to halt all future dealings inNigeriawith any
Swiss nationals until these names are revealed."
"That is your privilege, Minister," replied the chairman, unmoved.
"And we may also have to reconsider every contract currently being negotiated by your countrymen in
Nigeria. And in addition I shall personally see to it that no penalty clauses are honoured."
"Would you not consider such action a little precipitate?"
"Let me assure you, Mr Gerber, that I would not lose one moment of sleep over such a decision," said
Ignatius. "Even if my efforts to discover those names were to bring your country to its knees I would not
be moved."
"So be it, Minister," replied the chairman. "However, it still does not alter the policy or the attitude of
this bank to confidentiality."
"If that remains the case, sir, this very day I shall give instructions to our Ambassador to close our
Embassy inGenevaand I shall declare your Ambassador inLagospersona nongrata."
For the first time the chairman raised his eyebrows.
"Furthermore," continued Ignatius, "I will hold a conference inLondonwhich will leave the world's press
in no doubt of my Head of State's displeasure with the conduct of this bank. After such publicity I feel
confident you will find that many of your customers would prefer to close their accounts, while others
who have in the past considered you a safe haven may find it necessary to look elsewhere."
The Minister waited but still the chairman did not respond.
"Then you leave me no choice," said Ignatius, rising from his seat.
The chairman stretched out his arm, assuming that at last the Minister was leaving, only to watch with
horror as Ignatius placed a hand in his jacket pocket and removed a small pistol. The two Swiss bankers
froze as the Nigerian Minister of Finance stepped forward and pressed the muzzle against the chairman's
temple.
"I need those names, Mr Gerber, and by now you must realise I will stop at nothing. If you don't supply
them immediately I'm going to blow your brains out. Do you understand?"
The chairman gave a slight nod, beads of sweat appearing on his forehead. "And he will be next," said
Ignatius, gesturing towards the young assistant, who stood speechless and paralysed a few paces away.
"Get me the names of every Nigerian who holds an account in this bank," Ignatius said quietly, looking
towards the young man, "or I'll blow your chairman's brains all over his soft pile carpet. Immediately, do
you hear me?" he added sharply.
The young man looked towards the chairman, who was now trembling but said quite clearly, "Non,
Pierre,jamais."
"D'accord," replied the assistant in a whisper.
"You can't say I didn't give you every chance." Ignatius pulled back the hammer. The sweat was now
pouring down the chairman's face and the young man had to turn his eyes away as he waited in terror for
the pistol shot.
"Excellent," said Ignatius, as he removed the gun from the chairman's head and returned to his seat.
Both the bankers were still trembling and quite unable to speak.
The Minister picked up the battered briefcase by the side of his chair and placed it on the glass table in
front of him. He pressed back the clasps and the lid flicked up.
The two bankers stared down at the neatly packed rows of hundred-dollar bills. Every inch of the
briefcase had been taken up. The chairman quickly estimated that it probably amounted to around five
million dollars.
"I wonder, sir," said Ignatius, "how I go about opening an account with your bank?"
ï¿½LA CARTE
ARTHUR Hapgoodwas demobbed onNovember 3rd, 1946. Within a month he was back at his old
workplace on the shop-floor of the Triumph factory on the outskirts ofCoventry.
The five years spent in the Sherwood Foresters, four of them as a quartermaster seconded to a tank
regiment, only underlined Arthur's likely post-war fate, despite having hoped to find more rewarding
work once the war was over. However, on returning to England he quickly discovered that in a "land fit
for heroes" jobs were not that easy to come by, and although he did not want to go back to the work he
had done for five years before war had been declared, that of fitting wheels on cars, he reluctantly, after
four weeks on the dole, went to see his former works' manager at Triumph.
"The job's yours if you want it, Arthur," the works' manager assured him.
"And the future?"
"The car's no longer a toy for the eccentric rich or even just a necessity for the businessman,"the works'
manager replied. "In fact," he continued, "management are preparing for the 'two-car family'."
"So they'll need even more wheels to be put on cars," said Arthur forlornly.
"That's the ticket."
Arthur signed on within the hour and it was only a matter of days before he was back into his old
routine. After all, he often reminded his wife, it didn't take a degree in engineering to screw four knobs on
to a wheel a hundred times a shift.
Arthur soon accepted the Act that he would have to settle for second best. However, second best was
not what he planned for his son.
Mark had celebrated his fifth birthday before his father had even set eyes on him, but from the moment
Arthur returned home he lavished everything he could on the boy.
Arthur was determined that Mark was not going to end up working on the shop-floor of a car factory
for the rest of his life. He put in hours of overtime to earn enough money to ensure that the boy could
have extra tuition in maths, general science and English. He felt well rewarded when the boy passed his
eleven-plus and won a place at King Henry VIII Grammar School, and that pride did not falter when
Mark went on to pass five O-levels and two years later added two A-levels.
Arthur tried not to show his disappointment when, on Mark's eighteenth birthday, the boy informed him
that he did not want to go to university.
"What kind of career arc you hoping to take up then, lad?" Arthur enquired.
"I've filled in an application form to join you on the shop-floor just as soon as I leave school."
"But why would you -"
"Why not?Most of my friends who are leaving this term have already been accepted by Triumph, and
they can't wait to get started."
"You must be out of your mind."
"Come off it, Dad. The pay's good and you've shown that there's always plenty of extra money to be
picked up with overtime. And I don't mind hard work."
"Do you think I spent all those years making sure you got a first-class education just to let you end up
like me, putting wheels on cars for the rest of your life?" Arthur shouted.
"That's not the whole job and you know it, Dad."
"You go there over my dead body," said his father. "I don't care what your friends end up doing, I only
care about you. You could be a solicitor, an accountant, an army officer, even a schoolmaster. Why
should you want to end up at a car factory?"
"It's better paid thanschoolmastering for a start," said Mark. "My French master once told me that he
wasn't as well off as you."
"That's not the point, lad-"
"The point is, Dad, I can't be expected to spend the rest of my life doing a job I don't enjoy just to
satisfy one of your fantasies."
"Well, I'm not going to allow you to waste the rest of your life," said Arthur, getting up fromthe
breakfast table. "The first thing I'm going to do when I get in to work this morning is see that your
application is turned down."
"That isn't fair, Dad. I have the right to-"
But his father had already left the room, and did not utter another word to the boy before leaving for the
factory.
For over a week father and son didn't speak to each other. It was Mark's mother who was left to come
up with the compromise. Mark could apply for any job that met with his father's approval and as long as
he completed a year at that job he could, if he still wanted to, reapply to work at the factory. His father
for his part would not then put any obstacle in his son's way.
Arthur nodded. Mark also reluctantly agreed to the solution.
"But only if you complete the full year," Arthur warned solemnly.
During those last days of the summer holiday Arthur came up with several suggestions for Mark to
consider, but the boy showed no enthusiasm for any of them. Mark's mother became quite anxious that
her son would end up with no job at all until, while helping her slice potatoes for dinner one night, Mark
confided that he thought hotel management seemed the least unattractive proposition he had considered
so far.
"At least you'd have a roof over your head and be regularly fed," his mother said.
"Bet they don't cook as well as you, Mum," said Mark as he placed the sliced potatoes on the top of
theLancashirehot-pot. "Still, it's only a year."
During the next month Mark attendedseveral interviews at hotels around the country without success. It
was then that his father discovered that his old company sergeant was head porter at theSavoy:
immediately Arthur started to pull a few strings.
"If the boy's any good," Arthur's old comrade-in-arms assured him over a pint, "he could end up as a
head porter, even a hotel manager." Arthur seemed well satisfied, even though Mark was still assuring his
friends that he would be joining them a year to the day.
On September Ist , 1959, Arthur and Mark Hapgood travelled together by bus toCoventrystation.
Arthur shook hands with the boy and promised him, "Your mother and I will make sure it's a special
Christmas this year when they give you your first leave. And don't worry - you'll be in good hands with
'Serge'. He'll teach you a thing or two. Just remember to keep your nose clean."
Mark said nothing and returned a thin smile as he boarded the train. "You'll never regret it . . ." were the
last words Mark heard his father say as the train pulled out of the station.
Mark regretted it from the moment he set foot in the hotel.
As a junior porter he started his day at six in the morning and ended at six in the evening. He was
entitled to a fifteen-minute mid-morning break, a forty-five-minute lunch break and another fifteen minute
break around mid-afternoon. After the first month had passed he could not recall when he had been
granted all three breaks on the same day, and he quickly learned that there was no one to whom he could
protest. His duties consisted of carrying guests' cases up to their rooms, then lugging them back down
again the moment they wanted to leave. With an average of three hundred people staying in the hotel
each night the process was endless. The pay turned out to be half what his friends were getting back
home and as he had to hand over all his tips to the head porter, however much overtime Mark put in, he
never saw an extra penny. On the only occasion he dared to mention it to the head porter he was met
with the words, "Your time will come, lad."
It did not worry Mark that his uniform didn't fit or that his room was six foot by six foot and overlooked
Charing Cross Station, or even that he didn't get a share of the tips; but it did worry him that there was
nothing he could do to please the head porter- however clean he kept his nose.
Sergeant Crann, who consideredtheSavoynor thing more than an extension of his old platoon, didn't
have a lot of time for young men under his command who hadn't done their national service.
"But I wasn'teligible to do national service," insisted Mark. "No one born after 1939 was called up."
"Don't make excuses, lad."
"It's not an excuse, Sarge. It's the truth."
"And don't call me 'Serge'. I'm 'Sergeant Crann' to you, and don't you forget it."
"Yes, Sergeant Crann."
At the end of each day Mark would return to his little box-room with its small bed, small chair and tiny
chest of drawers, and collapse exhausted. The only picture in the room - of the Laughing Cavalier was on
the calendar that hung above Mark's bed. The date ofSeptember 1st, 1960, was circled in red to remind
him when he would be allowed to rejoin his friends at the factory back home. Each night before falling
asleep he would cross out the offending day like a prisoner making scratch marks on a wall.
At Christmas Mark returned home for a four-day break, and when his mother saw the general state of
the boy she tried to talk his father into allowing Mark to give up the job early, but Arthur remained
implacable.
"We made an agreement. I can't be expected to get him a job at the factory if he isn't responsible
enough to keep to his part of a bargain."
During the holiday Mark waited for his friends outside the factory gate until their shift had ended and
listened to their stories of weekends spent watching football, drinking at the pub and dancing to theEverly
Brothers. They all sympathised with his problem and looked forward to him joining them in September.
"It's only a few more months," one of them reminded him cheerfully.
Far too quickly, Mark was on the journey back toLondon, where he continued unwillingly to hump
cases up and down the hotel corridors for month after month.
Once the English rain hadsubsided the usual influx of American tourists began. Mark liked the
Americans, who treated him as an equal and often tipped him a shilling when others would have given him
only sixpence. But whatever the amount Mark received Sergeant Crann would still pocket it with the
inevitable, "Your time will come, lad."
One such American for whom Mark ran around diligently every day during his fortnight's stay ended up
presenting the boy with a ten-bob note as he left the front entrance of the hotel.
Mark said, "Thank you, sir," and turned round to see Sergeant Crann standing in his path.
"Hand it over," said Crann as soon as the American visitor was well out of earshot.
"I was going to the moment I saw you," said Mark, passing the note to his superior.
"Not thinking of pocketing what's rightfully mine, was you?"
"No, I wasn't," said Mark. "Though God knows I earned it."
"Your time will come, lad," said Sergeant Crann without much thought.
"Not while someone as mean as you is in charge," replied Mark sharply.
"What was that you said?" asked the head porter, veering round.
"You heard me the first time, Sarge."
The clip across the ear took Mark by surprise.
"You, lad, have just lost your job. Nobody, but nobody, talks to me like that." Sergeant Crann turned
and set off smartly in the direction of the manager's office.
The hotel manager, Gerald Drummond, listened to the head porter's version of events before asking
Mark to report to his office immediately. "You realise I have been left with no choice but to sack you,"
were his first words once the door was closed.
Mark looked up at the tall, elegant man in his long, black coat, white collar and black tie. "AmI allowed
to tell you what actually happened, sir?" he asked.
Mr Drummond nodded, then listened without interruption as Mark gave his version of what had taken
place that morning, and also disclosed the agreement he had entered into with his father. "Please let me
complete my final ten weeks," Mark ended, "or my father will only say I haven't kept my end of our
bargain."
"I haven't got another job vacant at the moment," protested the manager."Unless you're willing to peel
potatoes for ten weeks."
"Anything," said Mark.
"Then report to the kitchen at six tomorrow morning. I'll tell the third chef to expect you. Only if you
think the head porter isa martinet just wait until you meet Jacques, ourmaï¿½tre chef de cuisine . He won't
clip your ear, he'll cut it off."
Mark didn't care. He felt confident that for just ten weeks he could face anything, and at five thirty the
following morning he exchanged his dark blue uniform for a white top and blue and white check trousers
before reporting for his new duties. To his surprise the kitchen took up almost the entire basement of the
hotel, and was even more of a bustle than the lobby had been.
The third chef put him in the corner of the kitchen, next to a mountain of potatoes, a bowl of cold water
and a sharp knife. Mark peeled through breakfast, lunch and dinner, and fell asleep on his bed that night
without even enough energy left to cross a day off his calendar.
For the first week he never actually saw the fabled Jacques. With seventy people working in the
kitchens Mark felt confident he could pass his whole period there without anyone being aware of him.
Each morning at six he would start peeling,then hand over the potatoes to a gangling youth called Terry
who in turn would dice or cut them according to the third chef's instructions for the dish of the day.
Monday sautï¿½, Tuesday mashed, Wednesday French-fried, Thursday sliced, Friday roast, Saturday
croquette... Mark quickly worked out a routine which kept him well ahead of Terry and therefore out of
any trouble.
Having watched Terrydo his job for over a week Mark felt sure he could have shown the young
apprentice how to lighten his workload quite simply, but he decided to keep his mouth closed: opening it
might only get him into more trouble, and he was certain the manager wouldn't give him a second chance.
Mark soon discovered that Terry always fell badly behind on Tuesday's shepherd's pie and Thursday's
Lancashirehot-pot. From time to time the third chef would come across to complain and he would glance
over at Mark to be sure that it wasn't him who was holding the process up. Mark made certain that he
always had a spare tub of peeled potatoes by his side so that he escaped censure.
It was on the first Thursday morning in August (Lancashirehot-pot) that Terry sliced off the top of his
forefinger. Blood spurted all over the sliced potatoes and on to the wooden table as the lad began yelling
hysterically.
"Get him out of here!" Mark heard themaï¿½tre chef decuisine bellow above the noise of the kitchen as he
stormed towards them.
"And you," he said, pointing at Mark, "clean up mess and start slicing rest of potatoes.I 'aveeight
hundred hungry customers still expecting to feed."
"Me?" said Mark in disbelief. "But-"
"Yes, you.You couldn't do worse job than idiot who calls himself trainee chef and cuts off finger." The
chef marched away, leaving Mark to move reluctantly across to the table where Terry had been working.
He felt disinclined to argue while the calendar was there to remind him that he was down to his last
twenty-five days.
Mark set about a task he had carried out for his mother many times. The clean, neat cuts were
delivered with a skill Terry would never learn to master. By the end of the day, although exhausted, Mark
did not feel quite as tired as he had in the past.
At eleven that night themaï¿½tre chef docuisine threw off his hat and barged out of the swing doors, a sign
to everyone else they could also leave the kitchen once everything that was their responsibility had been
cleared up. A few seconds later the door swung back open and the chef burst in. He stared round the
kitchen as everyone waited to see what he would do next. Having found what he was looking for, he
headed straight for Mark.
;'Oh, my God," thought Mark. "He's going to
"How is your name?" the chef demanded.
"Mark Hapgood, sir," he managed to splutter out.
"You waste on 'tatoes, Mark Hapgood," said the chef. "You start on vegetables in morning.Report at
seven. If that cretin with half finger ever returns, put him to peeling 'tatoes."
The chef turned on his heel even before Mark had the chance to reply. He dreaded the thought of
having to spend three weeks in the middle of the kitchens, never once out of themaï¿½tre chef decuisineï¿½s
sight , but he accepted there was no alternative.
The next morning Mark arrived at six for fear of being late and spent an hour watching the fresh
vegetables being unloaded fromCovent Gardenmarket. The hotel's supply manager checked every case
carefully, rejecting several before he signed a chit to show the hotel had received over three thousand
pounds' worth of vegetables. An average day, he assured Mark.
Themaï¿½tre chef de cuisine appeared a few minutes beforeseven thirty, checked the menus and told
Mark to score the Brussels sprouts, trim the French beans and remove the coarse outer leaves of the
cabbages.
"But I don't know how," Mark replied honestly. He could feel the other trainees in the kitchen edging
away from him.
"Then I teach you," roared the chef. "Perhaps only thing you learn is if hope to be good chef, you able
to do everyone's job in kitchen, even 'tatopeeler's."
"But I'm hoping to be a . . ." Mark began and then thought better of it. The chef seemed not to have
heard Mark as he took his place beside the new recruit. Everyone in the kitchen stared as the chef began
to show Mark the basic skills of cutting, dicing and slicing.
"And remember other idiot's finger," the chef said on completing the lesson and passing the razor-sharp
knife back to Mark. "Yours can be next."
Mark started gingerly dicing the carrots,then the Brussels sprouts, removing the outer layer before
cutting a firm cross in the stalk. Next he moved on to trimming and slicing the beans. Once again he found
it fairly easy to keep ahead of the chef's requirements.
At the end of each day, after the head chef had left, Mark stayed on to sharpen all his knives in
preparation for the following morning, and would not leave his work area until it was spotless.
On the sixth day, after a curt nod from the chef, Mark realised he must be doing something half right. By
the following Saturday he felt he had mastered the simple skills of vegetable preparation and found
himself becoming fascinated by what the chef himself was up to. Although Jacques rarely addressed
anyone as he marched round the acre of kitchen except to grunt his approval or disapproval - the latter
more commonly- Mark quickly learned to anticipate his needs. Within a short space of time he began to
feel that he was part of a team - even though he was only too aware of being the novice recruit.
On the deputy chef's day off the following week Mark was allowed to arrange the cooked vegetables in
their bowls and spent some time making each dish look attractive as well as edible. The chef not only
noticed but actually muttered his greatest accolade- "Bon."
During his last three weeks at the SavoyMark did not even look at the calendar above his bed.
One Thursday morning a message came down from the under-manager that Mark was to report to his
office as soon as was convenient. Mark had quite forgotten that it was August 31st- his last day. He cut
ten lemons into quarters,then finished preparing the forty plates of thinly sliced smoked salmon that would
complete the first course for a wedding lunch. He looked with pride at his efforts before folding up his
apron and leaving to collect his papers and final wage packet.
"Where you think you're going?" asked the chef, looking up.
"I'm off," said Mark."Back toCoventry."
"See you Monday then. You deserve day off."
"No, I'm going home for good," said Mark.
The chef stopped checking the cuts of rare beef that would make up the second course of the wedding
feast.
"Going?" he repeated as if he didn't understand the word.
"Yes. I've finished my year and now I'm off home to work."
"I hope you found first-class hotel," said the chef with genuine interest.
"I'm not going to work in a hotel."
"A restaurant, perhaps?"
"No, I'm going to get a job at Triumph."
The chef looked puzzled for a moment, unsure if it was his English or whether the boy was mocking
him.
"What is - Triumph?"
"A place where they manufacture cars."
"You will manufacture cars?"
"Not a whole car, but I will put the wheels on." "You put cars on wheels?" the chef said in disbelief.
"No," laughed Mark."Wheels on cars."
The chef still looked uncertain.
"So you will be cooking for the car workers?"
"No. As I explained, I'm going to put the wheels on the cars," said Mark slowly, enunciating each word.
"That not possible."
"Oh yes it is," responded Mark. "And I've waited a whole year to prove it."
"If I offered you job ascommis chef, you change mind?" asked the chef quietly.
"Why would you do that?"
"Because you 'avetalent in those fingers. In time I think you become chef, perhaps even good chef."
"No, thanks.I'm off toCoventryto join my mates."
The head chef shrugged. "Tantpis," he said, and without a second glance returned to the carcass of
beef. He glanced over at the plates of smoked salmon. "A wasted talent," he added after the swing door
had closed behind his potential protï¿½gï¿½.
Mark locked his room, threw the calendar in the wastepaper basket and returned to the hotel to hand in
his kitchen clothes to the housekeeper. The final action he took was to return his room key to the
under-manager.
"Your wage packet, your cards and your PAYE.Oh, and the chef has phoned up to say he would be
happy to give you a reference," said the under-manager."Can't pretend that happens every day."
"Won't need that where I'm going," said Mark.
"But thanks all the same."
He started off for station at a brisk pace, his small battered suitcase swinging by his side, only to find
that each step took a little longer. When he arrived at Euston he made his way to Platform 7 and began
walking up and down, occasionally staring at the great clock above the booking hall. He watched first
one train and then another pull out of the station bound forCoventry. He was aware of the station
becoming dark as shadows filtered through the glass awning on to the public concourse. Suddenly he
turned and walked offal an even brisker pace. If he hurried he could still be back in time to help chef
prepare dinner that night.
Mark trained under Jacques le Renneu for five years. Vegetables were followed by sauces, fish by
poultry,meats bypï¿½tisserie . After eight years at theSavoyhe was appointed second chef, and had learned
so much from his mentor that regular patrons could no longer be sure when it was themaï¿½tre chef de
cuisine ï¿½sday off. Two years later Mark became a master chef, and when in 1971 Jacques was offered
the opportunity to return to Paris and take over the kitchens of the George Cinq - an establishment that is
to Paris what Harrods is to London - Jacques agreed, but only on condition that Mark accompanied him.
"It is wrong direction fromCoventry," Jacques warned him, "and in any case they sure to offer you my
job at theSavoy."
"I'd better come along otherwise those Frogs will never get a decent meal."
"Those Frogs," said Jacques, "will always know when it's my day off."
"Yes, and book in even greater numbers," suggested Mark, laughing.
It was not to be long before Parisians were flocking to the George Cinq, not to rest their weary heads
but to relish the cooking of the two-chef team.
When Jacques celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday the great hotel did not have to look far to appoint his
successor.
"The first Englishman ever to bemaï¿½tre chef de cuisine at the George Cinq," said Jacques, raising a
glass of champagne at his farewell banquet. "Who would believe it? Of course, you will have to change
your name to Marc to hold down such a position."
"Neither will ever happen," said Mark.
"Oh yes it will, because I 'averecommended you."
"Then I shall turn it down."
"Going to put cars on wheels,peut-ï¿½tre ?" asked Jacques mockingly.
"No, but I have found a little restaurant on theLeft Bank. With my savings alone I can't quite afford the
lease, but with your help . . ."
Chez Jacques opened on the rueduPlaisir on theLeft BankonMay 1st, 1982, and it was not long before
those customers who had taken the George Cinq for granted transferred their allegiance.
Mark's reputation spread as the two chefs pioneered "nouvelle cuisine", and soon the only way anyone
could be guaranteed a table at the restaurant inunder three weeks was to be a film star or a Cabinet
Minister.
The day Michelin gave Chez Jacques theirthird star Mark, with Jacques's blessing, decided to open a
second restaurant. The press and customers then quarrelled amongst themselves as to which was the
finer establishment. The booking sheets showed clearly the public felt there was no difference.
When in October 1986 Jacques died, at the age of seventy-one, the restaurant critics wrote confidently
that standards were bound to fall. A year later the same journalists had to admit that one of the five great
chefs ofFrancehad come from a town in the British Midlands they could not even pronounce.
Jacques's death only made Mark yearn more for his homeland, and when he read in theDaily
Telegraph of a new development to be built inCovent Gardenhe called the site agent to ask for more
details.
Mark's third restaurant was opened in the heart ofLondononFebruary 11th, 1987.
Over the years Mark Hapgood often travelled back toCoventryto see his parents. His father had retired
long since but Mark was still unable to persuade either parent to take the trip toParisand sample his
culinary efforts. But now he had opened in the country's capital he hoped to tempt them.
"We don't need to go up toLondon," said his mother, laying the table. "You always cook for us
whenever you come home, and we read of your successes in the papers. In any case, your father isn't so
good on his legs nowadays."
"What do you call this, son?" his father asked a few minutes later asnoisette of lamb surrounded by
baby carrots was placed in front of him.
"Nouvelle cuisine."
"And people pay good money for it?"
Mark laughed and the following day prepared his father's favouriteLancashirehot-pot.
"Now that's a real meal," said Arthur after his third helping. "And I'll tell you something for nothing, lad.
You cook it almost as well as your mother."
A year later Michelin announced the restaurants throughout the world that had been awarded their
coveted third star. The Times let its readers know on its front page that Chez Jacques was the first
English restaurant ever to be so honoured.
To celebrate the award Mark's parents finally agreed to make the journey down toLondon, though not
until Mark had sent a telegram saying he was reconsidering that job at British Leyland. He sent a car to
fetch his parents and had them installed in a suite at theSavoy. That evening he reserved the most popular
table at Chez Jacques in their name.
Vegetable soup followed by steak and kidney pie with a plate of bread and butter pudding to end on
were not thetable d'hï¿½te that night, but they were served for the special guests on Table 17.
Under the influence of the finest wine, Arthur was soon chatting happily to anyone who would listen and
couldn't resist reminding the head waiter that it was his son who owned the restaurant.
"Don't be silly, Arthur," said his wife. "He already knows that."
"Nice couple, your parents," the head waiter confided to his boss after he had served them with their
coffee and supplied Arthur with a cigar.
"What did your old man do before he retired?Banker, lawyer, schoolmaster?"
"Oh no, nothing like that," said Mark quietly. "He spent the whole of his working life putting wheels on
cars."
"But why would he waste his time doing that?" asked the waiter incredulously.
"Because he wasn't lucky enough to have a father like mine," Mark replied.
